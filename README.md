# KeyLogger-And-ScreenLogger-Virus

This is a keylogger and screenlogger application that operates in a stealthy manner, bypassing Windows Defender using injection techniques. It modifies its structure to evade structure-based detection and runs as a no-console application, ensuring that it operates silently without the user's awareness.

## Disclaimer

- **Screenlogging**: The application captures screenshots at regular intervals.
- **Clipboard Monitoring**: The application monitors the clipboard and logs its contents.
- **Wi-Fi Password Retrieval**: The application retrieves stored Wi-Fi network names (SSIDs) and their corresponding passwords on the target machine.
